        <h2>1. Difference Between Local Storage And Session Storage</h2>
        <h2 style="text-align:center ;">Local Storage</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The data stored in it has no expiration date
                The storage limit is about 10MB
            </li>
            <li>
                Its data is never transferred to the server
                Cons
            </li>
            <li>
                Its data is plain text; hence it is not secure by design
            </li>
            <li>
                The data type is limited to string; hence it needs to be serialized
                Data can only be read on the client-side, not on the server-side
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="text-align:center ;">Session Storage</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It is preferred over cookies because it is much more intuitive than using cookies to store things.
            </li>
            <li>
                Less back and forth to the server
            </li>
            <li>
                A cookie is size limited to 4kb and using session storage you can have much more data saved per
                session
            </li>
            <li>
                Faster page loads

        </ul>

        <h2>1. Difference Between Local Storage And Session Storage</h2>
        <h2 style="text-align:center ;">Local Storage</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The data stored in it has no expiration date
                The storage limit is about 10MB
            </li>
            <li>
                Its data is never transferred to the server
                Cons
            </li>
            <li>
                Its data is plain text; hence it is not secure by design
            </li>
            <li>
                The data type is limited to string; hence it needs to be serialized
                Data can only be read on the client-side, not on the server-side
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="text-align:center ;">Session Storage</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It is preferred over cookies because it is much more intuitive than using cookies to store things.
            </li>
            <li>
                Less back and forth to the server
            </li>
            <li>
                A cookie is size limited to 4kb and using session storage you can have much more data saved per
                session
            </li>
            <li>

        <h2>2. Difference Between Global Scope And block Scope. </h2>
        <h3 style="text-align:center ;">Global Scope</h3>
        <p>
            Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block
            simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples
            of structure that create a code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible
            from anywhere in the code.
        <h3 style="text-align:center ;">Blog Scope </h3>
        <p> block scope is similar to a function scope, but is limited to a block instead of a function.As of ES3, a
            catch clause in try / catch statements has a block scope, which means that it has its own scope. It's
            important to note that the try clause does not have a block scope, only the catch clause does.As of ES6, let
            and const variables are attached implicitly to the current block scope instead of the function scope. This
            means that these variables are limited to the block they were declared in, whether it's an if block, a for
            block, or a function.

        <h2>3. How to work event loop?</h2>
        <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is
            empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
            effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
